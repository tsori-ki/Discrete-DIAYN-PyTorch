# Discrete-DIAYN-PyTorch

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

This is a PyTorch implementation of **Discrete-DIAYN** (Diversity is All You Need) — a discrete action-space variant of the original DIAYN algorithm. It adapts DIAYN to work with environments where actions are **discrete**, enabling skill discovery without any extrinsic reward signal.

This project is forked from [alirezakazemipour/DIAYN-PyTorch](https://github.com/alirezakazemipour/DIAYN-PyTorch), which was designed for **continuous control** tasks using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC).

## Motivation

While intelligent agents in nature learn diverse and useful skills **without external rewards**, many RL algorithms rely on explicitly defined reward functions.

DIAYN reformulates this by maximizing **diversity** through skill discovery: the agent receives intrinsic rewards based on how **distinguishable** each skill is from others. In this discrete version, we adapt the same philosophy to environments with **discrete action spaces**.

The DIAYN reward is given by:

where $z$ is the latent skill. The intrinsic reward encourages states that help a discriminator identify which skill was used.

## Features

* 🧠 Skill discovery in **discrete action** environments
* 🎮 Based on PyTorch & OpenAI Gym
* 🧪 Compatible with simple control environments (e.g., `Acrobot`, `CartPole`)
* 🧩 Modular design (agent, logger, networks)
* 💾 Checkpointing + RNG state saving

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running

```bash
python3 main.py --mem_size=100000 --env_name="Acrobot-v1" --interval=50 --do_train --n_skills=10
```

### Options

```bash
optional arguments:
  --env_name ENV_NAME         Name of the environment
  --interval INTERVAL         Save/log every n episodes
  --do_train                  Train the agent (vs. test mode)
  --train_from_scratch        Start training from scratch
  --mem_size MEM_SIZE         Replay buffer size
  --n_skills N_SKILLS         Number of skills to learn
  --reward_scale REWARD_SCALE Reward scaling factor
  --seed SEED                 Random seed for reproducibility
```

To resume from checkpoints:

```bash
python3 main.py --env_name="Acrobot-v1" --mem_size=100000 --do_train --train_from_scratch
```
